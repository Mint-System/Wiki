# Billability

New employees at Mint System have to learn new methodologies, understand previous design decisions and most of all learn to work with Odoo.

The time required to learn and close the knowledge gap cannot be invoiced. And therefore the company pays for it. Over time the employee closes this knowledge gap and becomes more billable.

When new employees start it can be expected that only 20% of their time is billable. The goal is to reach a billable time of 80%. How to get there depends on the project utilization, the employees experience and resource allocation.

**Project Utilization**

In the best case the employee can work fulltime on a project and build knowledge in a local domain. When the employee works on multiple project it takes more time the build up the local domain knowledge.

**Experience**

If the employees already has knowledge about Odoo and other systems used at Mint System, the knowledge can be sold directly. However, it is not expected that new employees have any prior knowledge about the systems in place.

**Skill Match**

Making a good match of the employee skills and project task is the main goal. Doing so is a challenge. We think that employees perform best if their abilities match the requirements of the task.
