# Odoo Module Test Instructions

As an alternative to add demo data and writing actual tests, a developer or business analyst can add a file `tests/TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.rst` to the module.

> The test instructions should be written in manner so that they could be translated to actual code.

> The test instructions are meant to be a functional verification and not a user manual nor a feature description of the module.
