// I would like to process the view definition files in the `./bases` folder and output them as markdown table.
// The input data of the views are the markdown files and their frontmatter.
// Have a look at `./Prozesse.base.md` to see the expected output.
// Can you complete the `./generate-base-views.js` file?
// Use `js-yaml` to read the bases file.
// Use `front-matter` to read the frontmatter of the markdown files.
// Note that the filters are strings and can be run as js code.
// To process the markdown files create a list of objects with attributes.
// Don't hardcode the field names of the view defintions.
// Only add comments for functions and for loops.
// Use pnpm instead of npm.
