Lightweight Kubernetes.

Website: <https://k3s.io/>

## Setup

We recommend to setup the cli according to <https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start---install-script>. After installation run `sudo chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`.

If you are using [[Zsh]] and [[Oh-My-Zsh]] make sure to use the `kubectl` plugin.
