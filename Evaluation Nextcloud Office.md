# Evaluation Nextcloud Office

Which one is better [[Collabora]] or [[OnlyOffice]]?

## Collabora

Installed Nextcloud apps:
- Collabora Online (supported)

Result:

Cannot be used as of 08.12.2020: <https://help.nextcloud.com/t/web-interface-very-slow-after-upgrade-from-20-0-1-to-20-0-2-rc1/98358/3>

## OnlyOffice

The communiy document server still does not work as of 08.12.2020. Decided to test the docker image.

Use OnlyOffice.
