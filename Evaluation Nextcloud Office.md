# Evaluation Nextcloud Office

Which one is better [[Collabora]] or [[OnlyOffice]]?

## Collabora

Installed Nextcloud apps:

- Collabora Online (supported)
- Collabora Online - Built-in CODE Server (unsupported)

Result:

Cannot be used as of 08.12.2020: <https://help.nextcloud.com/t/web-interface-very-slow-after-upgrade-from-20-0-1-to-20-0-2-rc1/98358/3>

## OnlyOffice

Installed Nextcloud apps:

- OnlyOffice (supported)
- Community Document Server (unsupported)

The communiy document server still does not work as of 08.12.2020. Decided to test the docker image.

Docker image seems to work.

Cons:

- Dokumentmetadaten werden nur in .docx unterst√ºtzt

## Descision

Use OnlyOffice.
