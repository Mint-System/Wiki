# Explaining Odoo

We tell customers that out-of-the-box Odoo (including EE) is similar to a raw construction building. Livable, but misses critical business features (for your industry).
We as partner help you completing the building (using OCA modules, Snippets and if necessary custom developments)

OCA: <https://github.com/OCA>
Snippets: <https://odoo.build/snippets.html>
Custom Development: <https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/browse?author=Mint%20System%20GmbH>
