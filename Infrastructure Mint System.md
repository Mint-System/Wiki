## Infrastructure Mint System

A short introduction into the infrastructure of Mint System.

---

### Drivers

Early on we wanted to be able to self-host web application.

ERP-Systems are operating system for companies

- They have to be hosted reliably
- Companies want know where their data is

Infrastructure as Code:

- Every system / server can be rebuilt from code
- The deployment of configuration must be automated

Run apps with Docker containers:

- Manage containers not apps
- Every decent web app provides Docker images

---

### Hardware

We don't want to manage hardware. We use these providers:

- Hetzner
- Exoscale
- Infomaniak
- Ungleich

And service partners.

---

### Ansible

Everything is done with Ansible. There is a role for that: <https://ansible.build/#roles>

- Install and configure the OS
- Manage firewalls and access rights
- Deploy Docker containers
- Manage backups and cron jobs
- Build Wireguard networks

---

### Hosting

We provide a managed server service.

Every customer has a server. No shared environments.

Every application is a hosting offer.

---

### Scripts

For things that cannot be automated there are scripts: <https://ansible.build/scripts.html>

Ansible roles rely on these helper scripts. Helper scripts work independent of Ansible.

---

### Monitoring

To monitor servers, containers and applications we use Prometheus/Grafana.

Prometheus provides "Exporters" for many applications. Data collection and visualization is simple.

---

### Backup

Backups are defined in Ansible and are done using [[Restic]].

- In Ansible inventory a backup set is defined
- Ansible creates a cron job to run the backup
- The backup job uses helper scripts to create local backups
- The local backups are snapshoted with restic to the backup server
- All backup data on the backup server is mirrored to an S3 bucket

---

### Proxy

On every server there is Nginx-instance running.

The Nginx config is generated by Ansible: <https://ansible.build/roles/nginx/>

Some roles require specific configs: <https://ansible.build/roles/collabora_code/#nginx-config>

Certificates are managed with certbot and let's encrypt.

---

### Auth

We a running Keycloak and integrate it using OAuth/OpenID Connect.

It is possible to manage all Keycloak config in Ansible.

---

### Security

We try to apply best practices:

- Update our applications / Docker images
- Linux server patching
- Basics: fail2ban, ssh pubkey, named users

Nginx WAF with OWASP has been tried. It was too much effort to train.

---

### Challenges

**Configuration drift**

One an Ansible role or a config is update we have to apply this change to all hosts. This rarely done.

**Proxy config not integrated**

The proxy config is not provided by the Ansible role. It would be better if the application provides the config.

**Backup verification**

We cannot be sure that all backups are working. So far they did.
