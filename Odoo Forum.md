### How do I record a bank transfer from two accounts in different currencies with a specific exchange rate?

I have two accounts - one in USD and the other in EURO.

I want to move $USD 100 from the first into the second, but I can't find a way to do it that gives me the ability to record a specific exchange rate - as the ones in Odoo will never match what my bank gives me.
