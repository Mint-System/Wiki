# Odoo Zertifizierung

Für jede Odoo-Version werden Zertifizierungen angeboten.

## Informationen von Odoo

- You **only have one shot.** A test lasts 60 minutes and you have 80 questions to reply to. If you fail one time, Odoo will ask you to rebuy another certification. 
- The modules you need to know are: Inventory, MRP, CRM, eCommerce, Intro (=Data-Base management and settings), HR, Timesheets, Project, Accounting, Purchase, Sales and Studio    
- The questions are only on the functional part of Odoo Enterprise. Not the code or  technical aspects. Be very well prepared,  as the test is more difficult than it seems.
- You can test your knowledge on this Sample Test: [https://www.odoo.com/de_DE/slides/odoo-functional-certification-sample-test-50](https://www.odoo.com/de_DE/slides/odoo-functional-certification-sample-test-50)
- Pay attention to the **negative points** (-0.5 per wrong answer). If you doubt your answer, it's better to answer "I don't know".  
- The wording can be quite tricky as well (sentences with double-negation, for instance).
- Don't hesitate to spend a few additional days **studying** by, for instance, opening a trial database, playing around with a database on [runbot.odoo.com](http://runbot.odoo.com/), consulting the user documentation or doing some e-learning modules that show advanced features ([https://www.odoo.com/de_DE/slides](https://www.odoo.com/de_DE/slides))
- Btw, if you watch these e-learning videos, I advise you not only to replicate the steps that "Amy-Caroline" is making, but also to try out features she's not demonstrating (in particular those options that need to be activated in the settings of each module).
-This video, that we broadcasted during the Odoo Experience may help you: [Becoming an Odoo expert: how to prepare for the certification?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYaAoMnQvhM)
- Finally, the certification is a pretty cheap marketing tool as more and more customers are looking for certified partners.
