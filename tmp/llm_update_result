feat(search): replace docsearch with slimsearch for improved local search performance

The commit replaces the Algolia DocSearch plugin with VuePress's slimsearch plugin to enhance local search functionality. This change removes external dependencies on Algolia services and implements a lightweight, client-side search solution with content indexing enabled and suggestions disabled for faster performance. The configuration updates include removing docsearch-specific settings and adding slimsearch with optimized options. Additionally, the package dependencies have been updated to reflect this change.
