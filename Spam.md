# Spam

Receiving malicious emails is an alltime problem for users.

## Identify spam

Ask yourself these question to properly identify an email:

- Wording is odd: Does the mail contain grammatical errors or mispronounced names?
- Expectation: Do you expect this email?
- Link preview: Hover over the link and check its preview url. Does it seem right?

**Example**

Kurt received this email:

![[Spam Mail Example.png]]

The sender was faked and on all terms it seems valid.

However, if you hover over the main button, a obscure link is shown:

![[Spam Mail hover link.png]]

Therefore this mail is spam.
