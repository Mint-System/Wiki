### Everything is XML

Odoo can be extended easily

---

### Inherit a Model

```py
from odoo import models

class ProductProduct(models.Model):
    _inherit = "product.product"

    _sql_constraints = [
        (
            "default_code_uniq",
            "unique(default_code)",
            "Internal Reference must be unique across the database!",
        )
    ]
```

<template id="website_product_description.product" inherit_id="website_sale.product">
	<xpath expr="//div[@id='product_details']/div/p" position="replace">
		<p t-field="product.web_description" class="text-muted mt-3" />
	</xpath>
</template>
```
