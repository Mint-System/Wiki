# Nextcloud Marketing

To run Nextcloud you need a managed server, automated backups, 24/7 monitoring and software updates.

We don't want you to worry about this needs, even if Nextcloud runs in your own data center.

We have the right tools [^1] to provision Nextcloud on any GNU/Linux server.

Being in charge of your data with the help of Nextcloud requires Open Source Software [^2] competence. Mint System provides exactly this. We gladly help you to regain control.
